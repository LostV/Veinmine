# Veinmine by LostV

A Valheim mod that allows you to mine entire veins of ore at once by holding a modifier key (defaults to Left Alt).

## Features
- Recursive mining: mined connected blocks in a vein with a single swing.
- Modifier key: Only activates when you hold down the Left Alt key.
- Safe chunking: Accurately grabs connected ore blocks of the same type via breadth-first search.

## Installation
1. Download and install [BepInExPack Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/).
2. Extract the `veinmine.dll` into your `Valheim/BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## Usage
- Hold the modifier key (`Left Alt`) while striking a rock or ore vein. 
- The entire contiguous vein (or up to 2000 blocks) will be damaged at once.
